<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Generally, in shops, hotels, offices, railway stations, notice/ display boards are used. They are frequently used to display messages, notices, or for advertisement purposes. However, it is a tedious task to change it every day. So, here is the Smart Display Board. This project aims to develop a wireless display board that displays messages sent via an Android Application (Smart Display Board App). Whenever a user sends a message, it publishes in the Firebase Realtime Database. Whenever the message changes in the firebase, the NodeMCU fetches it from the firebase and displays it on the LCD screen.</p>

<p>Also, there are two modes in which you can send your message to LCD. The first one is Text Mode, and the second is Speech mode. In-text mode, you have to type your message manually in the app and hit the send button. Whereas in speech mode, you can vocalize your message, it will automatically send it to the firebase.</p>
